# Image Generation with Diffusion Models

This project demonstrates how to generate images using diffusion models, specifically utilizing the Stable Diffusion model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.


## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 
- Libraries listed in the notebook (`diffusers`, `transformers`, `tensorflow`, etc.)


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `text-to-image.ipynb`.
2. Replace `"YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_AUTH_TOKEN"` with your actual Hugging Face authentication token.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the code and generate images.
4. Follow the information provided within the notebook to customize prompts and adjust parameters.
